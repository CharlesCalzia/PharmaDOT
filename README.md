# PharmaDOT

## Overview

In our project, we leverage Polkadot Parachains and Astar to enhance security and transparency in multiple supply chains within the pharmaceutical industry. Our primary goal is to establish a robust QR code tracking system that enables end-to-end traceability of pharmaceutical products.

## Polkadot

We deployed a Parachain on Polkadot enabling supply chain actors to transfer pill to one another. Transactions are recorded on the chain. End users then can then trace back the pills they bought by looking at the different transactions and their timestamps.

## Astar

The second aspect of our project was using NFTs on the Astar blockchain. Upon manufacture of a package of pills, an NFT would be minted for that package of pills. As the package of pills travels through each stage of the supply chain, the NFT is transferred to the next supply chain actor (with the package). The NFT itself is a QR code which is attached to the package and once purchased by the consumer, can be read to track the cycle of the NFT.
